# Townsend Quantum Mechanics textbook solutions&notes
 This repository includes solutions and notes to Townsend's A Modern Approach to Quamtum Mechanics 2nd edition. The solutions are to supplement those on https://kevinshuang.com/projects/a-modern-approach-to-quantum-mechanics/ , which covers the solutions to the 1st edition of the book. As I am an ongoing self-learner of this subject, my solutions are prone to mistakes. I will try to update this repository in synchrotron with my self-study pace as a mean of reviewing. If you identify a mistake in this repository or consider this repository to violate certain rules, please contact me and I will make changes in accordance.
